# ICAO â€“ N-Number Converter

Script converting ICAO addresses to N-Numbers (Tail Numbers) and reciprocally. Only works for United States aircraft registrations.

## Using the converter

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Nothing else =)

### Install

Using `pip install`
```bash
pip install icao_nnumber_converter_us
```

Usage of the `n_to_icao` and `icao_to_n` functions. Note that both functions return `None` on invalid input.

```python
python3
>>> from icao_nnumber_converter_us import n_to_icao, icao_to_n
>>> n_to_icao("N12345")
'a061d9'
>>> icao_to_n("abcdef")
'N86QU'
```

Or simply clone the repo, and start converting.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guillaumemichel/icao-nnumber_converter.git
cd icao-nnumber_converter
```

Convert N-Number to ICAO address
```bash
> python3 convert.py N12345
a061d9
```

Convert ICAO address to N-Number
```bash
> python3 convert.py abcdef
N86QU
```

## Format & Mapping

ICAO addresses are hexadecimal values of length 6. US registered ICAO addresses start with 'a'. N-Numbers, or Tail Numbers, are alphanumerical strings at most 6 characters long. US registered Tail Numbers start with 'N' (that's why they are called N-Number, yes!). Their format is as defined below.

There is a direct sequential mapping from US ICAO addresses to N-Number, from a00001 for N1 to adf7c7 for N99999. The mapping is somewhat intuitive, but not convenient to implement.

The mapping goes like this:

| ICAO address | N-Number |
|--------------|----------|
| a00001       | N1       |
| a00002       | N1A      |
